# PIP Installation

For an up to date version of PIP, the better is to use the `get-pip` installer:

``` bash
$ wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
$ sudo python ez_setup.py
$ wget https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
$ sudo python get-pip.py
$ pip --version
```

Alternatively, using APT:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

But chances are that the packaged version is old (in early 2014, Ubuntu 12.04 (last LTS at this time) provides the 1.0 version, the `get-pip` installer provides the 1.5).

For further details, please refer to the [PIP Reference installation guide](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html).
